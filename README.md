# Welcome to The Simulator!

Inspired by glitch art and the early 2000s internet, “adhd.exe" is an interactive digital artwork retro-fitted to emulate a Windows XP internet explorer and simulates different ADHD experiences through browser tabs.

Please note that not all people with ADHD (and neurodivergents by extension) experience the same symptoms in the same way. This simulator is my own artistic representation of my own experiences. However, I do hope that many of you can relate to aspects of it.

# Zoned Out
“Huh? What? Ja, no of course I was listening”

# Hyperfocus
I have a report to finish for work but it is imperative that I learn what it takes to become a pet immigration specialist.

# To-do List
"I don’t need to write that down. I’ll remember” Yeah right…

# Sensory Overload
Everything is too loud and everything is too bright. The tag on my shirt makes me want to flip tables. MAKE IT STOP!
P.S. Drag the Nervous System pop-up for a neat surprise that’s sure to distract you from navigating the rest of this browser.

# Daydreaming
Get lost in a landscape of reveries and glitch fantasies. Who needs TV when you’ve got one in your noggin? 
Quote lines from MTV’s Catfish or watch Twilight by head. Infinite entertainment!

# Reading
Reading isn’t so relaxing when you can’t even get past the first page.
