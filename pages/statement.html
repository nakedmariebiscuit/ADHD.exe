            "adhd.exe" is an interactive digital artwork that invites viewers to step inside the multifaceted world of ADHD. Designed as a virtual journey through browser tabs, each segment of the website embodies a unique ADHD experience, from the intensity of hyperfocus to the overwhelming swirl of sensory overload and the serene drift of daydreaming. The work is inspired by glitch art, AR, vaporwave, and mixed media, reflecting my passion for blending traditional collage art with digital techniques.

            Having been diagnosed with ADHD in 2018, my mission is to share the complexities and nuances of ADHD through my art. "adhd.exe" is not just an educational tool but a visceral experience that allows users to navigate the mind of someone with ADHD, to create understanding in a way that bypasses conventional text-based approaches. The familiarity of of a browser enhances this immersion, transforming the learning journey into an intuitive exploration.

            This piece is also an ode to the digital ecosystem of the early 2000s, evoking the nostalgia of Windows XP and the internet of my youth. By incorporating these elements, I aim to create a connection that resonates with different audiences – people with ADHD (diagnosed or undiagnosed) and those without it can relate to different parts of the simulation. I believe that the constant “under construction” and unstructured form of the early 2000s internet with its raw personal expression from users who created their own homepages was a great way to reflect the vibrant chaos that can be the ADHD mind.
        </p>

            Through this artwork, I hope to bridge the gap between awareness and experience, inviting everyone to engage with the ADHD narrative in a personal and meaningful way.
