# Zoned Out
“Huh? What? Ja, no of course I was listening”

#Hyperfocus
I have a report to finish for work but it is imperative that I learn what it takes to become a pet immigration specialist.

#To-do List

# Daydreaming
Get lost in a landscape of reveries and glitch fantasies. Who needs TV when you’ve got one in your noggin? 
Quote lines from MTV’s Catfish or watch Twilight by head. Infinite entertainment!
